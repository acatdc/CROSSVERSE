# Alpha-DCL Retro Testing Tuesdays

Release date: May 2023.

Target participants rate: 20 people.

## DISCLAIMER

At this stage, we are testing our first Player VS Player (PvP1) mechanic, a mode where players can compete with each other. All you will see during the tests are very rough sketches. In the future, we will replace it with nice 3D models, and add sounds, animations, etc.

Join the Discord channel to chat with the CROSSVERSE team - [https://discord.gg/a52ZeewZ](https://discord.gg/a52ZeewZ). **Link expires 1st of June**

Keep in mind, please. that team response in chats can be within 24 hours.

About the rewards:
During the Alpha-DCL stage, there will be several prize rounds. In the end, all leaders will be rewarded in the form of DCL wearables by DAPPCRAFT. Details will be announced in our Discord. 

**Would be awesome** if you help us to promote and spread the word about CROSSVERSE. Please share any screenshots and videos with gameplay (especially with funny moments) in your social media presence. In this case please use special hashtags combo: 

***#CROSSVERSE #alpha1 #XVRS @crossverse_xvrs @decentraland #metaverse***

## PvP1 mode

This is a game where the player's task is to build the most broad and dense network. The network is built by installing nodes and then connecting them together. Only 1 node can be installed on one parcel, so the space for network deployment is limited by the number of parcels in the world. And you are not alone in this world ;)

To be able to play and experience CROSSVERSE augmented reality layer you should have Hyp-0 NFT on your wallet and login into the DCL through our portal: [https://play.crossverse.world/](https://play.crossverse.world/)

In fact, you will connect absolutely the same original DCL infrastructure but with CROSSVERSE enhancements such as Hyp-0 and augmented reality features.

### General rules & recommendations

- You can do three simple actions: 1) [Create your node](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md); 2) [Link your nodes](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md); 3) [Hack into other nodes](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md). As well you can do many misc actions such as [sniffing](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md) and [finger-printing](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md).. but they are rather secondary and non-mandatory to play with.
- There can be **no more than 1 node** per parcel of land.
- You can connect *nodes* placed in neighboring parcels into a growing network. [Hyp-0](./../platform-entities-7aa70bd04d014e659a0071fa62f9cbbd/hyp-0-5bcb88hac9aapou5d-47f3bc403e914210908ca1289bad2fc2.md) attempts to do this [automatically when you create *nodes* sequentially](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md) in neighboring parcels. If you move too far away, [Hyp-0](./../platform-entities-7aa70bd04d014e659a0071fa62f9cbbd/hyp-0-5bcb88hac9aapou5d-47f3bc403e914210908ca1289bad2fc2.md) will lose the connection with the previous *node* and the new *node* will be out of connection with the previous, as a result, your network will have a gap but [you can connect them manually](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md) later on.
- Bigger your network - the better.
- You can build as many separate networks as you want. And you can join them together in one huge network by [linking them](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md).
- Linking between the *nodes* matters. How? - you will have to figure this out empirically over time.
- Hacking - Allows you to convert a node from another network into a node in your network. But this comes **at a risk**.
- Hacking: **probabilities** - When attempting to hack a network that is the same size as yours, the probability of a successful hack is 50%. If your network is twice as large, the chance of successful hack doubles. Similarly the opposite - if you try to hack a network that is twice your size, there is a twice bigger chance of failure in your try.
- Hacking: **the risks** - In the case of an unsuccessful attempt to hack into someone else’s network - another network takes over your active node. Simply put, you lose your node.
- UI messages: If something went wrong, take your attention to Hyp-0 terminal messages. You should be able to see error messages which lead you to a better understanding of what the issue is.
- The map mode: As for now we have very wonky-monkey Map visualization with issues. One of them is that when you build your network too far from the Genezis Plaza (the center of the DCL world), the map detail suffers because of a lack of resolution. So we recommend you keep your networks as close to Genesis Plaza as possible.

### UI commands

- Setup —`<?>` setFingerprint
    
    Digital signature of your nodes. Why is it needed? It's totally up to you actually.. for example - you can put there your phone number… so any time someone approaches your node he could call you and ask your permission to hack you. At this alpha-2 stage you can have one fingerprint for all of your nodes at once but later on you will be able to assign unique fingerprints for each node.
    
- **<.`<?>`**		create node
    
    Attempt to create a node. Not more than one node per parcel. 
    
- <?`<?>`		instructions
    
    Link to the page with instructions and tips.
    
- <O`<?>`	map
    
    All nodes registered in the system can be seen on this map. To get an updated map just refresh the page.
    
- <../`<?>`	finish PvP1
    
    Exit PvP1 mode and return to the main menu.
    
- <+`<?>`		link nodes
    
    Attempt to connect two nodes together. This way your network grows.
    
- <x`<?>`		hack node
    
    Attempt to hack this node. If successful it becomes yours, otherwise, you will lose your active node. For details please refer to the [RULES](./alpha-dcl-retro-testing-tuesdays-2818c27bf9d44fcab389ff557f073515.md) page
    
- <.#`<?>`	edit node fingerprint
    
    Digital signature of this node.
    
- (.)		bind to the node (make it active\primary)
    
    Make a node *active*. An *active node* is a node from which connections are automatically built.  
    
- #.#		Firewall the node
    
    TBA
    
- <.-.-.`<?>`	sniffing
    
    Scan the selected node underlying the network to see how many nodes are in it.

### Known issues

- General recommendation for any gameplay and visual issues - try to disable\enable Hyp-0.
- Sometimes Hyp-0 or his elemets disappear. In this case try to turning Hyp-0 OFF and ON again.
- Website not working or endless loading screen. In this case try to use VPN.
- You cant stop making new nodes and go sleep because you afraid that someone will hack your network at night. Well… we understand your concerns and have no solution at the moment, because each team member very busy by making our own nodes RIGHT NOW! :E :E :E .
