# Alpha-2 stage

Release date: Sept. 2023.

Target participants rate: 30-100 people.

## DISCLAIMER

At this stage, we are testing our first Player VS Player (PvP1) mechanic, a mode where players can compete with each other. Since the alpha-1 stage, we have implemented drastic changes on the backend to solve a lot of unpleasant moments that the alpha-1 participants faced. These changes have allowed us to implement unique experience: shared multiplayer **augmented reality** on top of Decentraland virtual reality. 

All you will see during the tests **are very rough sketches**. In the future, we will replace it with nice 3D models, and add sounds, animations, vfx etc.

Keep in mind, please, that team response in chats can be within 24 hours.

Within this alpha-2 stage we temporary restrict access to alpha-1 exploration mode.

About the rewards:
During the alpha-2 stage, there will be several prize rounds, at the end of which all leaders will be rewarded in the form of $MANA tokens. Details can be found below. 

**Would be awesome😘** if you help us to promote and spread the word about CROSSVERSE. Please share any screenshots and videos with gameplay (especially with funny moments) in your social media presence. In this case please use special hashtags combo: 

***#CROSSVERSE #alpha2 #XVRS @crossverse_xvrs @decentraland #metaverse***

## PvP1 mode

This is a game where the player's task is to build the most broad and dense *network*. The *network* is built by installing [*nodes*](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) and then connecting them together. Only 1 [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) can be installed on one parcel, so the space for network deployment is limited by the number of parcels in the world. And you are not alone in this world ;)

To be able to play and experience CROSSVERSE augmented reality layer you should have Hyp-0 NFT on your wallet and login into the DCL through our portal: [https://play.crossverse.world/](https://play.crossverse.world/)

In fact, you will connect absolutely the same original DCL infrastructure but with CROSSVERSE enhancements as such as Hyp-0 and augmented reality features.

### Activation session

The session will take place 4 days before the tournament. The purpose of this session is that all participants come to the tournament prepared. Its important because everything will be on test-net environment.

There is simple few actions you have to check:

- Login into DCL test-net client via this link: [https://play.crossverse.world](https://play.crossverse.world/)
- Wear TEST Hyp-0 (backpack -`<?>` acc -`<?>` earrings -`<?>` Hyp-0 TEST)
- Build at least 1 [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)
- Build a network of two or more connected [nodes](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)
- Drop a message in the # alpha2 chat in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hzxEWzh2cb)

There are extra actions which we recommend to check as well:

- Opening *the map* and checking your network on it
- [Hacking](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) another player's [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)
- Posting a screenshot of the map with your network in # alpha2 chat in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hzxEWzh2cb).

There is video demonstration of all these steps passed through:

Round 2: Sep 13 - Sep 14 (24 hours)
Round 3: Sep 15 - Sep 17 (48 hours)
Round 4: Sep 18 - Sep 20 (48 hours)

- **Rewards**
    
    We allocated total **2,000 $MANA in prizes.**

    **Special nominations:**
    
    - **Miner award**
        
        700 $MANA pool. Players who will create 100+ nodes will share a guaranteed reward proportional to the number of nodes created. The pool is 100/150/200/250 $MANA for each corresponding round.
        
    - **Kevin Mitnick award**
        
        300 $MANA pool for true HACKER-man’s! As the most risk-taking players who has made the highest number of attempts to hack other nodes, regardless of whether the attempt is successful or not. 40/60/80/120 $MANA for each corresponding round.
        
    - ***Extra cases**
        - The winner of the round automatically excluded from other nominations in this round.
        - If there is two players qualified as /the winner/ of this round, in this rare case both of them share the prize pool.
- **Tournament rules**
    - Using bots and scripts to trick the system and other players is not allowed. Any suspicious player with that activity will be disqualified.

### General rules & recommendations

- You can do three simple actions: 1) [Create your node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md); 2) [Link your nodes](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md); 3) [Hack into other nodes](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md). As well you can do many misc actions such as [sniffing](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) and [finger-printing](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md).. but they are rather secondary and non-mandatory to play with.
- There can be **no more than 1 [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)** per parcel of land. If someone installed his node already you can not install your in that parcel.
- You can connect [*nodes](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)* placed in neighboring parcels into a growing network. [Hyp-0](./../platform-entities-7aa70bd04d014e659a0071fa62f9cbbd/hyp-0-5bcb88hac9aapou5d-47f3bc403e914210908ca1289bad2fc2.md) attempts to do this [automatically when you create *nodes* sequentially](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) in neighboring parcels. If you move too far away, [Hyp-0](./../platform-entities-7aa70bd04d014e659a0071fa62f9cbbd/hyp-0-5bcb88hac9aapou5d-47f3bc403e914210908ca1289bad2fc2.md) will lose the connection with the previous *node* and the new *node* will be out of connection with the previous, as a result, your network will have a gap but [you can connect them manually](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) later on.
- Bigger your network - the better.
- You can build as many separate networks as you want. And you can join them together in one huge network by [linking them](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md).
- Linking between the [*nodes*](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) matters. How? - you will have to figure this out empirically over time.
- **Limit on nodes**: There is a cap of 120 available nodes in your Hyp-0 storage. As well there is 30 seconds cooldown before regenerating a node in your storage.
- Hacking - Allows you to convert a node from another network into a node in your network. But this comes **at a risk**.
- Hacking: **probabilities** - When attempting to hack a network that is the same size as yours, the probability of a successful hack is 50%. If your network is twice as large, the chance of successful hack doubles. Similarly the opposite - if you try to hack a network that is twice your size, there is a twice bigger chance of failure in your try.
- Hacking: **the risks** - In the case of an unsuccessful attempt to hack into someone else’s network - another network takes over your [active node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md). Simply put, you lose your node.
- UI messages: If something went wrong, take your attention to Hyp-0 terminal messages. You should be able to see error messages which lead you to a better understanding of what the issue is.
- The map mode: As for now we have very wonky-monkey Map visualization with issues. This is alpha stage ;)

### UI commands

- Setup —`<?>` setFingerprint
    
    Digital signature of your nodes. Why is it need? Its totally up to you actually.. for an example - you can put there your phone number… so any time some-one approach your node he could call you and ask your permission to hack you. At this alpha-2 stage you can have one fingerprint for all of your nodes at once but later on you will be able to assign unique fingerprints for each node.
    
- **<.`<?>`**		create [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) *(shortcut : E)*
    
    Attempt to create a [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md). Not more than one node per parcel. 
    
- <?`<?>`		rtfm
    
    Link to the page with instructions and tips.
    
- <O`<?>`	the map
    
    All nodes registered in the system can be seen on this map. To get an updated map just refresh the page.
    
- <../`<?>`	exit PvP1
    
    Exit PvP1 mode and return to main menu.
    
- <+`<?>`		link [nodes](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) *(shortcut : E)*
    
    Attempt to connect two nodes together. This way your network grows.
    
- <x`<?>`		hack [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) *(shortcut : E)*
    
    Attempt to hack this node. If successful it become yours, otherwise you will lose your active node. For details please refer to [RULES](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) page
    
- <.#`<?>`	edit node fingerprint
    
    Digital signature of this particular node.
    
- (.)		bind to the [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) (make it active\primary) *(shortcut : F)*
    
    Make a node *active*. An *active node* is a node from which connections are automatically build.  
    
- #.#		firewall the [node](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)
    
    TBA
    
- <.-.-.`<?>`	sniffing
    
    Scan selected node underlying network to see how much nodes in it which gives you a sense of power of the network.

### Known issues

- General recommendation for any gameplay and visual issues - try to disable\enable Hyp-0 wearable.
- Sometimes Hyp-0 or his elemets disappear. In this case try to turning Hyp-0 OFF and ON again.
- Website not working or endless loading screen. In this case try to use VPN. In some cases it can takes up to 5-7 minutes to load..
- General experience is laggy. Yes.. its happened often at this stage of production, especially when 1000+ nodes installed on the map. We trying our best to optimize it.
- You cant stop making new nodes and go sleep because you afraid that someone will hack your network at night. Well… we understand your concerns and have no solution at the moment, because each team member very busy by making our own nodes RIGHT NOW! :E :E :E .

### FAQ

What is a “node” ? : Node is an asset in form of a black parallepiped, which installed by player on the parcel to mark it as owned by this particular player. For other details please refer to [General rules](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md) page.

### Round2 updates

After amazing feedback we received from Round1 we decided to introduce radical changes to the game mechanics to address balance issues between two types of players: one side is those who are ready to play for many hours without a break and others (the majority) who cannot afford to spend more than an hour or two per round.

Changes:

1. We introduce new entity in the game, lets call it "Energy".
2. Your Hyp-0 can have a maximum Energy reserve of 400.
3. At the beginning of the Round each player has 300 Energy.
4.  Energy regenerates with at speed of 1 Energy per 2.8 minutes.
5. Deploying a node consume 1 Energy
6. Hacking attempt consume 1 Energy
7. Hacker’s “[**lucky punch**](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)” - when your hacking attempt is successefull then by [*random](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)** case you can hack TWO connected nodes at a time. Where random case is depends on the size of your network compared to enemy’s network: the smaller your network is compared to enemy’s net, the greater the chance of [“lucky punch](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md)”.
- The math behind hacker’s “Lucky punch” feature
    
    table showing probability relative to the proportion of two networks.
    
    ```
    | proportion| probability|
    | --------- | ---------- |
    | 1 to 99   |     99%    |
    | 50 to 50  |     50%    |
    | 99 to 1   |     1%     |
    ```
    

### Round3 updates

Our players asked us to try a short-term game. So we decide to do it. And again with some new features in terms of rebalancing the system, and marking it more action-oriented, similar to Round1. 

Cnanges from R2 balance:

1. The round duration is 2.5 hours
2. The map size is 70x70
3. Your Hyp-0 can have a maximum Energy reserve of 500.
4. At the beginning of the Round each player has 250 Energy.
5. Energy regenerates with at speed of 1 Energy per 36sec.
6. **New in hacking mechanics:** If the hacking attempt fails, you lose your node due to the enemy's network taking over, BUT that node becomes unconnected to the enemy's network.

Changes in reward system:

1. The entire pool of rewards per round is halved due to the short time frame. And the other half is instead moved to the R4 reward pool.. Making it truly EPIC !
2. General winner reward for R3 is 100 $MANA
3. Mitnick award reward for R3 is 50 $MANA
4. Miner rewards pool for R3 is 150 $MANA

Good luck everyone ! May the Hyp-0 be with you. 

### Round4 updates

Final round is here. 48 hours long party with breaks ofc 🙂 The game balance for that round has been chosen so that players can spend ~3hours in total and be able to win.

- **Cnanges from R3 balance**:
    1. The round duration is 48 hours.
    2. Your Hyp-0 can have a maximum Energy reserve of 400.
    3. At the beginning of the Round each player has 300 Energy.
    4. Energy regenerates with at speed of 1 Energy per 168sec.
    5. **New in hacking mechanics:** If the hacking attempt fails the node from your network that you lose due to failed hacking attempt becomes neutral. 
    6. **Neutral nodes:** They marked by gray color. Probability to hack neutral node is 100%. You even can hack them without active connection with your other node.
    7. **New feature: [Firewall. Please refer to special chapter related to it](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md).**
    
- **Changes in reward system**:
    1. The entire pool of rewards per round has increased due to reduction from R3 reward pool.
    2. General winner reward for R3 is 250 $MANA
    3. Mitnick award is discarded due our unability to protect against hackers 😂 .
    4. Miner rewards pool for R3 is 700 $MANA (for players who spend 200+ energy via Round4)
- **Firewall feature**
    
    This mode is essential for players who want to take a break from the game. When you switch ON firewall - all your networks on the map get a multiplier to their base POWER parameter. Multiplier coeffecient is depend on your network base power so, that little networks get more protection multiplicator compared to huge networks.
    
    You can get an idea based on these three examples :
    
    - Base power 1 with activated firewall makes your power ~10 or 10x multiplier
    - Base power 300 with activated firewall makes your power ~1500 or 5x multiplier
    - Base power 1000 with activated firewall makes your power ~1200 or 1.2x multiplier
    
    **Keep in mind:**
    
    - Firewall [cost you 1% per hour](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md). (in nodes)
    - You can’t deploy new nodes and hack other nodes when firewall is activated.
    - There is 15 minutes cooldown between deactivation and subsequent activation of the firewall.
    - **Firewall price**.
        
        General cost is 1% per hour.
        
        As soon as you activate the firewall, the system immediately write off 1% of your nodes. They became [*netural nodes*](./alpha-2-stage-99525832050b4ba9b5d5fb3d7f964a35.md). And so on each next hour until you turn off firewall mode. But minimum 1 node.
