# FAQ

## What metaverses are supported by CROSSVERSE?

Any Web3.0 ready metaverse can be integrated into the CROSSVERSE network.

[List of metaverses already supported](./partnerships.md)

## What metaverses are NOT supported by CROSSVERSE?

Only those metaverses that support blockchain entities can be integrated into CROSSVERSE. We use blockchain as a technological layer for building the CROSSVERSE network.

## How can the new metaverse be integrated into CROSSVERSE?

We are building CROSSVERSE as an open platform where anyone can access all traffic that connects all participants **in all** of the metaverses we support.

At some point, we will open access to the CROSSVERSE API, which will give people the opportunity to direct traffic to their creations in any metaverse without our knowledge.

But in the first phases of platform development, this process will be carried out centralized case by case. Therefore, prior to the release of the CROSSVERSE API, please contact us through the appropriate communication channels.

## What blockchain does CROSSVERSE run on?

Any.

CROSSVERSE was conceived from the first day as a widely-scalable platform to which you can connect any metaverse where there is integration of blockchain technologies in one form or another.

We are building the CROSSVERSE API with this important aspect of interoperability in mind. And therein lies the fundamental significance of our platform for the ecosystem of the metaverses.

However, we start our journey with two blockchains: Ethereum and Polygon.
