# **What is CROSSVERSE?**

<details>
<summary>show</summary>

CROSSVERSE is **not a game** - it's a user traffic aggregation and management **platform** for [WEB 3.0 ready](./general-overview-8ba05a8fdd4d4438a5aa9d48195dde9b.md) metaverses.

**We're building a bridge** between the [WEB 3.0 ready](./general-overview-8ba05a8fdd4d4438a5aa9d48195dde9b.md) metaverses, providing a way for users to move between them easily. If you're familiar with the [DeFi](./general-overview-8ba05a8fdd4d4438a5aa9d48195dde9b.md) space, you can think of user traffic in the metaverse as similar to "liquidity" in [DeFi](./general-overview-8ba05a8fdd4d4438a5aa9d48195dde9b.md). The variety of metaverses is analogous to the variety of blockchains in [DeFi](./general-overview-8ba05a8fdd4d4438a5aa9d48195dde9b.md).

So, CROSSVERSE for the metaverses is effectively the same as [[1inch.io](https://1inch.io/)+[multichain.org](https://multichain.org/)] for [DeFi](./general-overview-8ba05a8fdd4d4438a5aa9d48195dde9b.md) - a way to aggregate and redistribute the ~~liquidity~~ user traffic.

# **What are we building?**

We are building a platform that will allow you to build a bridge to any metaverse! If the metaverse supports WEB 3.0 - it can be integrated into the CROSSVERSE. 

We have a lot of work to do, and we are starting with the Decentraland metaverse ([DCL](./general-overview.md)). Due to its wide range of technical capabilities for building complex user applications, and its longer history than any other WEB 3.0 metaverse, [DCL](./general-overview.md) is the ideal candidate for our first step in deploying the CROSSVERSE platform.

# Short term **roadmap**

### The first step consists of two key building blocks:

- Deployment of web interfaces for CROSSVERSE [*clients*](./general-overview.md).
- Deployment of gamified context inside [DCL](./general-overview.md) with elements of [p2e mechanics](./general-overview.md) for [*user*](./general-overview.md) rewards.

The result of the first step is a working platform where anyone can bring traffic on their location in [DCL](./general-overview.md) for a certain price. What [*client*](./general-overview.md) paid us will be distributed among CROSSVERSE [*user](./general-overview.md)s* equivalent to their activity.

<aside>
💡 A. More CROSSVERSE [*clients*](./general-overview.md) **→** higher user reward pool.
B. Higher user [reward pool](./general-overview.md) **→** more CROSSVERSE [*user](./general-overview.md)s*.
C. More CROSSVERSE [*user](./general-overview.md)s* **→** higher Metaverse traffic.
D. Higher Metaverse traffic **→** More CROSSVERSE [*clients*](./general-overview.md) **→**  A. **🧙‍♂️**
</aside>

### The second step includes essentially one of the most important elements:

Expansion to other metaverses.

The result of this phase will be a working model for tunneling user traffic between [DCL](./general-overview.md) and the first partner metaverses. And it will be fun, damn it! 🔥 [Join now!](https://discord.gg/hzxEWzh2cb)

# **And finally... What is the purpose?**

> **«traffic is king!»**
 @CROSSVERSE

In the roaring Metaverse landscape, “a new Metaverse” is announced almost every month... and that's normal at this stage of our industry. It is also normal and obvious that the vast majority of these metaverses, unfortunately, will not survive even on the near horizon.

What is the key criterion for the viability of the metaverse? - the presence of traffic. If people walk around and explore your world, then there is something in it.

We, the CROSSVERSE and DAPPCRAFT teams, are sincerely interested in the fact that our industry will grow and develop. The idea of CROSSVERSE was born as a result of reflection on the question - what can WE GIVE to the industry that we love so much and from which we ourselves are a fan?

Thanks to the CROSSVERSE platform:

- the metaverses get the vital traffic that circulates and powers our industry as a whole. In this competitive environment, in pursuit of traffic, creators will be forced to raise the bar for the quality of their creations in order to increase retention.
- landowners & content / event creators get a simple and understandable tool to draw attention to their creations. What to do next with this attention is already entirely in the hands of the landowner / creator. If the experience is worthwhile, people will certainly return without “external” incentives.
- users/guests/players of the metaverses generally get a whole range of opportunities:
    - ✔ learn something new and unexpected, discover a new interesting location or, what's the location .. - a whole metaverse! Or learn about a new digital artist, discover new web3.0 tools, etc..
    - ✔ A fun social experience... because CROSSVERSE is a whole gamified context for both singleplayer and multiplayer fans.
    - ✔ the opportunity to get a very real reward for spending **precious** time of your life on all these activities …

# Glossary

<aside>
💡 ***The client** - those who need traffic/attention and who are ready to pay for it. Client funds are one of the sources of the [user](./general-overview.md) [reward pool](./general-overview.md).*

</aside>

<aside>
💡 ***A user** - an individual member of the metaverse who has access to the platform in that role. The first access key for this role is [Hyp-0](./general-overview.md). CROSSVERSE users get unique access to [assignments](./general-overview.md) for which they are rewarded.*

</aside>

<aside>
💡 ***A nomad** - an individual member of the metaverse who owns [Hyp-0](./general-overview.md). These are adventurous players who are ready to go to different corners of the metaverses in search of new experiences.*

</aside>

<aside>
💡 **Reward pool ***- platform treasury, which is replenished from many sources and used to reward [nomads](./general-overview.md) and other active participants. There is a list of some (but not all) sources : 1) profit from selling traffic directly to platform clients. 2) platform revenue from the sale of NFTs. 3) commission received from secondary sales of our NFTs as well as official DEX pools fees.*

💡 ***P2E** - Short for Play To Earn. This term has taken root in the Web3.0 community and implies gaming activities for which participants are rewarded in the form of liquid assets, such as NFT tokens or ERC-20 tokens, etc. In general, everything that can eventually be exchanged for stablecoins, ETH and other external tokens of the DeFi ecosystem.*

💡 ***WEB 3.0** - The well-established name of the entire ecosystem of technologies built on the basis of blockchain and involving the identification of a user by signing him with a unique private key belonging to this user.*
