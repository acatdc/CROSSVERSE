# Project Backstory & Philosophy

In 2020 it was the second year since we (DAPPCRAFT) were actively involved in the kitchen of the metaverses, NFT, DAO and defi... The romanticism of the metaverses concept gave us enough energy to come home after our regular work (not related to metaverses) and sit at our computer and sometimes make new things for Decentraland till morning - whether it was a new wearable collection for an upcoming fashion week or funny interactive experiments for... just because :)

We were amazed at the intensity with which the whole “kitchen” was buzzing... and, of course, we were much reflecting on our role in it all... what we do, why and where it all goes.…

These questions allowed us a bit of a break from the routine of urgent "down-to-earth" tasks and encouraged us to fantasize about something bigger... on a different scale…

In the end, we agreed on a shared vision of the concept that there will not be one "winner" metaverse in the future.... That there would be a metaverse of metaverses! That new metaworlds with their own technical, stylistic and even cultural features would constantly appear... there would be hundreds if not thousands of them... localized worlds... they would evolve like living organisms, change in scale... prosper and decay... And the most important nourishing element of these digital-living systems would be human traffic.

The number of "inhabitants" of these local metaverses would be one of the most important indicators of its viability. (not the only one, of course).

## **Traffic is king !**

This is how CROSSVERSE came about - we realized that the future we see needs bridges between metaverses!

That all these metaverses will need people, and people will need an incentive to leave their usual habitats and go into the fog of the new and unexplored.

Yes, we already have web3.0 acting as a technological bridge. But that's not enough, the industry needs some kind of cross-metaverse experience context.…

This is how CROSSVERSE came about - as the idea of a cross-metaverse bridge that not only "is" there, but also beckons people to step into the fog of new discoveries and makes the experience relatively easy and safe..

CROSSVERSE - as a platform, which :

- gives people incentives to explore metaverses (both the one they are already used to being in and the ones they have never even imagined)
- provide developers by tools and incentives to build "bridges" between experiences... bridges over which people will move and discover new things.
- for creators, businesses and entire metaverses, it gives a simple and straightforward tool to draw attention to their creations.

**CROSSVERSE - is the quintessence of our aspirations to do something really meaningful for this whole crazy industry, which is the dawning of an even more mind-blowing future!**

But, as you know, everything big begins with a small thing. And the "small" in our case is - Hyp-0. [Meet him](./platform-entities/hyp-0.md) ;)
