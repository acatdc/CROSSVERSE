# Qbit’s [ˈkjuːbɪt]

# General description

An object shaped like a cube. In its normal state, it is located in the tail section of Hyp-0.

The minimum storage unit for various states of matter within CROSSVERSE. Each type of matter requires its own [Qbit type](./qbits.md).

[Hyp-0](./hyp-0.md) of higher rank are distinguished by a larger number of Qbits in their tail.

[Hyp-0](./hyp-0.md) can simultaneously carry qubits of different [types](./qbits.md).
