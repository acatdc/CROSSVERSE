# Alpha-1 stage

Release date: January 2023.

Target participants rate: 10 people.

## DISCLAIMER

At this stage, we are testing the technical aspects and infrastructure of the backend, as well as the most basic gameplay of [HYP-0](./platform-entities/hyp-0.md): activation**→**navigation**→**receiving rewards.
Now there are only 10 locations in our database and 30 routes to them (3 per location).

We deliberately did not make detailed gameplay instructions as we want to check how intuitive the process is now. General advice we should ask you - try to finish as many exploration tasks as you can. Maximum unique routes is 30 but you can finish as many as you want, not limited to 30.

Keep in mind please. that team response in chats can be within 24 hours.

Sincere request to our first players - do not judge the gameplay strictly at this stage :) It will be bo0o0o0o0oring, anno0o0o0o0oying and sometimes even painful )) What will be revealed to your eyes at this stage is only 1% of what we want to build. 

About the rewards:
The tokens that you will receive during the alpha tests are Goerly testnet tokens. However, we do not rule out that one day they may turn into non-test ones :) Anyway you can be sure that we see the contribution of each participant and will figure out how to thank you for your contribution.

**Would be awesome** if you help us to promote and spread the world about CROSSVERSE. Please share any screenshots and videos with gameplay (especially with funny bugs) in your social media presence. In this case please use special hashtags combo: 

***#CROSSVERSE #alpha1 #XVRS @crossverse_xvrs @decentraland #metaverse***

## Manual & How-to

Our team will get in touch with each of alpha1 stage participants and provide you with personal settings which you need before setup testing account.

These settings include :

- **Private key for your Metamask test account.**
- **Personal web link to enter Decentraland metaverse experimental mode.**

You have to use this new personal account and only your personal web-link to login in Decentraland. 

These complicated steps relevant only for current alpha stage. Public beta testing stage will be as simple as your ordinal Decentraland login.

Below you can see step by step instruction how to import an account and login in DCL.

## Hyp-0 UI

Your digital friend has quite oldschool interface to operate with.. General information can be found here: [Hyp-0 UI](./platform-entities/hyp-0.md)

There is a short description of each available commands:

- **`exploration`** : Start new task or resume uncompleted one.
- **`charge`** : Start charging process. Each location allow you to gather energy into [Qbits](./platform-entities/qbits.md) in the tail of your Hyp-0. One charge took one Qbit-space.
- **`exit`** : Close UI terminal.
- **`unload`** : Start 2 hours cooldown timer. You will not be able to start new task until the timer runs out. Usually you should not use this command **until** Hyp-0 ask you for that. When unload process is finished you can claim reward for each [Qbit](./platform-entities/qbits.md) which was charged.
- **`update`** : Update terminal window.
- **`claim`** : Activating the transfer of reward tokens from the system to your account. **Important!** *When you activate this command you communicate directly with blockchain thus sometimes your transaction can be delayed in a queue, in some rare cases this delay can last hours! You cant play with Hyp-0 until your transaction is approved. In normal case your transaction approved within a few seconds.*

## Known issues

There are several issues that every alpha1 participant will almost certainly face. We will mention here some of the most significant ones so that you are ready and know what to do in these cases.

### Empty world

Sometimes you can found out that the world seems empty… or Hyp-0 pointing you at empty parcel. Like the image below:

![Untitled](./alpha-1-stage/untitled.png)

One of the known reason of that issue is a long idle mode of your character. If you go out of your PC for a 5-10 minutes and comeback, there is big chance you will catch that issue.

**Solution**:

Close current session (web page) and reopen your personal web link we provided you as alpha tester.

### Scene visually seems broken

Sometimes the scene looks really weird.. for an example in the image below there is huge gray planes around… 

![Untitled](./alpha-1-stage/untitled-1.png)

**Solution**:

Close current session and reopen your personal alpha tester link we provide you. If it dosnt help, the issue can be in your browser GPU\hardware acceleration settings.. Anyway, please report in discord about your issue so we can see how many people face it. Alternatively you actually can continue with your exploration.. it should work.. just ignore this issue. 

### Whole page just freeze with no reaction to anything

**Solution**:

Close current session and reopen your personal alpha tester link we provide you.

### Slow\glitchy internet

We use unstable experimental DCL environment, which is very sensitive to your internet connection. Sometimes it lead to unpredicted issues like broken or incomplete scene loading.. spontaneous reload of the page.. etc… 

**Solution**:

We wish you strong nerves 

### I cant see Hyp-0

Sometimes you activate Hyp-0 but nothing happened.. (he actually appear but as invisible). Or Hyp-0 run away from you and you lost him… 

**Solution**:

Just deactivate Hyp-0 smart-wearable and activate it again. 

### I cant enter the door

In some scenes there can be broken mechanics for interactive elements like a doors, so you trying to open it but it just dosnt work… like the image below:

![Untitled](./alpha-1-stage/untitled-2.png)

**Solution**:

In this case you can try one of the options - 1) Just close whole page and reopen your personal alpha tester link. 2) Try to deactivate Hyp-0 smart-wearable and then activate it again and continue your exploration.

### There is annoying red boundaries cubes everywhere!

There is an example:

**Solution**:

Its only in your head… Its okay.
